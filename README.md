# Haskell Data Structures

Implementation of pure functional data structures in Haskell.

## Requirements

  - [ ] appendToTail -> a -> Node
  - [ ] remove_head -> Nothing
  - [ ] find -> a -> Maybe Node
- [ ] Tree
  - [ ] addChild -> a -> Tree
  - [ ] contains -> a -> Bool
  - [ ] remove -> a -> Maybe a
- [ ] Binary Search Tree
  - [ ] insert -> a -> BinarySearchTree
  - [ ] contains -> a -> Bool
  - [ ] traverseDepthFirstInOrder -> a -> a -> Nothing
- [ ] Graph
  - [ ] addNode -> a -> Nothing
  - [ ] removeNode -> a -> Nothing
  - [ ] contains -> a Bool
  - [ ] addEdge -> a -> a -> Nothing
  - [ ] hasEdge -> a -> a -> Bool
- [ ] Hash Map
  - [ ] insert -> Key a -> b -> b
  - [ ] retrieve -> Key a -> Maybe b
  - [ ] remove -> Key a -> Maybe a
- [ ] Heap
  - [ ] insert -> a -> Nothing
  - [ ] removeMax -> a
